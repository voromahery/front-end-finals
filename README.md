# Photograph

## Description
This site is built with [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/). This is suitable for photographers who want to show their works online.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Figma
- Figma Font Helper

## How to use it?

We'll be using `node-sass` for our Sass compilation. Let's install that by doing:

1. `npm i`

To compile the **Sass**, run the command below:

1. `npm run scss:watch`

Tip: All your Sass files will be output to the `webroot/css` folder.

## Getting started
